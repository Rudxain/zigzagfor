# zigzagfor.js
Inspired by [this](https://github.com/bjpop/js-turtle/blob/928d61589ccadca66cca618cfd48f8a45f2e9275/examples/sierpinski.js)

## Disclaimer
This repo is temporary, because I'll port it to Python. I no longer support JS. ~I'll delete this repo at any time without warning~

Perhaps I should create a branch for Py? But then, I'll have to rename the repo to zigzagfor.py
